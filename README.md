This is an interview task I made where you can add eight different instruments and play them simultaneously or individually,

You can loop thorugh each track and change loop position / length.

You can stop and pause all tracks or just one instrument.

You can mute and unmute all tracks or just one instrument.

Using [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) to display the waveform visualization and using `regions` plugin to interact with the audio loop regions.
